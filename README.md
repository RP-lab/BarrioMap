# Barrio Map: OSM for community mapping

## A Shiny web application to bridge between Open Access Mapping and Formal Planning Efforts


### Overview of the app

If you are searching for a simple map for community projects, this is the place. Made with urban planners, architects, and designers in mind, BarrioMaps will let you print to typical scales used in planning / design (1”=50’, etc.), print large sheet sizes (24”x36”, etc.), export in easily edited formats (pdf and vectors). Barrio Map with the goal of bridging the gap between open access mapping and formal planning efforts. Whether you’re an architecture student or a community member with a grassroots project, BarrioMap was made for you. 

### Technical Details
If you want to hear about the code, Barrio Map offers fundamental functionalities like finding locations by conducting searches or selecting coordinates. Users can select from predefined scales and export  the scaled maps to particular page sizes. Maps generated using Barrio Map are formal descriptions of particular sites with defined values of resolution, scales, and explicit information on distances. Barrio Map, in conjunction with OpenStreetMaps, is written in R, with functionalities largely leveraged from packages such as Leaflet and Shiny. 


### Why “Barrio Map”, why open source?
Traditional planning practices rely on licensed software to filter and interpret information from open source maps. The process of using open software for formal mapping is time-consuming and complex. Thus, only professionals have access to the necessary skills and software. Barrio Map is a comprehensive open source web-based mapping toolbox designed to bridge the gap between citizens and decision makers and add quantitative geo-referenced data to grassroots knowledge. The BarrioMap team believes that information is power, and should be accessible to all.
